## About

This is my latest portfolio. Assets were provided and the portfolio was created based off of a given design and mockup through the use of Figma. The Animate on Scroll package was used to give elements their animation when scrolling into view. HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and a custom-made Webpack template were utilized to incorporate code optimization, minification and auto vendor prefixing.
